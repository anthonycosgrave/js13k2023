# js13k2023 - The Horde! The Horde! The Horde!
My entry for the 2023 js13kgames.com competition. The theme was "13th Century".

It was made over a 4 day period leading up to the submission deadline on September 
13th 2023.

I used some art from the free Kenney 1-bit Pack https://kenney.nl/assets/1-bit-pack.

I wrote a little bit about it on my blog: https://imtoospexy.com/blog/js13k2023-13th-century/
